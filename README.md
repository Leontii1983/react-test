# react-test
To receive/retrieve the data, I used the server on node and express, which I have written beforehand. I transferred the data to JSON and uploaded it into Atlas.
The access to the database is opened from any IP (do you need to describe how you did it?). After downloading the project fromrepository, your first step would be to pull up 
the dependencies for the server, to install npm in the root of the server folder. The public folder contains react-application, go there and consequently pull up all dependencies
with the npm install. Both the server and the application are launched with the npm start command, in the root of each project folder.
